Hi! My name is Marta and I want to show you my first self-designed website. <br>
https://marta-tomczak.github.io/Homepage/

## ðŸ“ŽDescription:
The website presents a description of myself.

### ðŸ› Technologies:
I've used on my website some different technlogies and conventions. On the website you will find many uses and interactions of buttons. I try to use new skills all the time.

Now, I can specify such technologies and conventions as:
- HTML
- CSS (Grid/Flex modules)
- JavaScript
- BEM convention
- Immutability convention
- Markdown

#### Project Status
**In progress**.
